1. Acne breakouts. 

When sweat mixes with bacteria and oils on your skin, it can clog your pores. If you have acne-prone skin, this often means breakouts. Dermatologists recommend the following to help prevent acne:
- Blot sweat from your skin with a clean towel or cloth. Wiping sweat off can irritate your skin, which can lead to a breakout.
- Wash sweaty clothes, headbands, towels, and hats before wearing them again.
- Use non-comedogenic products on your face, neck, back, and chest. The label may also say “oil free” or “won’t clog pores.”



2. Dry, irritated skin

When outdoor air is hot and humid, you can still have dry irritated skin. The biggest culprits are spending time in the sun, pool, and air-conditioning. If your skin starts to feel dry and irritated despite the humidity, try these tips:
- Shower and shampoo immediately after getting out of the pool, using fresh, clean water and a mild cleanser or body wash made for swimmers.
- Apply sunscreen before going outdoors, using one that offers broad-spectrum protection, SPF 30+, and water resistance.
- Use a mild cleanser to wash your skin. Soaps and body washes labeled “antibacterial” or “deodorant” can dry your skin.
- Take showers and baths in warm rather than hot water.
- Slather on a fragrance-free moisturizer after every shower and bath. Moisturizer works by trapping water in your skin, so you’ll need to apply it within 5 minutes of taking a shower or bath.
- Carry moisturizer with you, so you can apply it after washing your hands and when your skin feels dry.
- Turn up the thermostat if the air conditioning makes your home too dry.



3. Folliculitis 

Every hair on your body grows out of an opening called a follicle. When follicles get infected, you develop folliculitis. Infected hair follicles look like pimples, but they tend to be itchy and tender. To reduce your risk of getting folliculitis:
- Immediately after your workout, change out of tight workout clothes like biking shorts and shower.
- Stay out of hot tubs and whirlpools if you’re unsure whether the acid and chlorine levels are properly controlled.So many people get folliculitis from a hot tub that there is actually a condition called “hot tub folliculitis.”
- Wear light-weight, loose-fitting clothes when it’s hot and humid.



4. Prickly heat (or heat rash)

Blocked sweat glands cause this. Because the sweat cannot get out, it builds up under your skin, causing a rash and tiny, itchy bumps. When the bumps burst and release sweat, many people feel a prickly sensation on their skin.
Anything you can do to stop sweating profusely will help reduce your risk. Tips that dermatologists offer to their patients to help them sweat less and thereby lessen their risk of getting prickly heat include:
- Wear light-weight, loose-fitting clothes made of cotton.
- Exercise outdoors during the coolest parts of the day or move your workout indoors where you can be in air-conditioning.
- Try to keep your skin cool by using fans, cool showers, and air-conditioning when possible.



5. Sunburn

Getting sunburn can spoil summer fun and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Here’s what you can do to prevent sunburned skin:
- Seek shade
- Wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, long sleeves, and pants when possible
- Apply sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum protection, SPF 30+, and water resistance



6. Sun allergy

You can develop hives (an allergic skin reaction) when you’re in the sun if you:
- Take certain medications
- Have a sun sensitivity (usually runs in the family)
If you have an allergic reaction to the sun, you’ll see red, scaly, and extremely itchy bumps on some (or all) bare skin. Some people also get blisters.
To prevent an allergic skin reaction:
- Check your medication container (or ask your pharmacist) to find out if it can cause an allergic reaction when you go out in the sun. Medications that can cause an allergic sun reaction include ketoprofen (found in some pain meds) and these antibiotics — tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. If the medicine can cause a reaction, stay out of the sun.
- Protect your skin from the sun. You can do this by seeking shade, wearing sun-protective clothes, and applying sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum protection, water resistance, and an SPF of 30 or more.



7. Scars

If the scars are old, you’ll have to just live with them. But you can diminish them when they’re new – less than a year old, Baumann says.
Scars that are thin, flat, white and tissue paper-like can sometimes be treated with a Fraxel laser, which pokes small holes in the skin.
“When it heals, the skin pulls together and is tighter,” Baumann explains.
Steroid injections can soften and improve the appearance of new, thin keloid scars, which are raised, bumpy and flesh-colored; older ones may have to be surgically removed.
Red scars can be treated with a vascular laser, which targets blood vessels, to tone down the color.
And the pockmarks left by a bad bout of acne? Try Fraxel lasers and injectible fillers, such as Restylane, which stimulate collagen production to help fill in depressed areas. In some cases, they can be surgically removed by a plastic surgeon.



8. Spider and varicose veins

A pulse dye laser can zap away facial spider veins, which are dilated blood vessels. The treatment requires about three visits to a dermatologist’s office, spaced a month apart. It will cause redness for a few days.
Sclerotherapy is the gold standard for treating varicose veins. After assessing the vein through an ultrasound, a physician injects an agent, such as glycerin, into the varicose vein.
“This causes the vein to immediately shrink and dissolve over a period of weeks,” Sobel says. A series of three injections are needed. You’ll also have to wear support stockings for a week after each treatment.
Any way to prevent varicose veins in the first place?
“Regular exercise, such as walking or running, improves leg strength and circulation,” Sobel says.
Also, keep off the extra pounds, don’t cross your legs while sitting and don’t stand in one place for long periods.



9. White spots

See your dermatologist immediately for a skin assessment to determine if you have vitiligo.
There’s no cure for the disorder, but treatments can restore some of the pigmentation. Topical or oral psoralen, for example, reacts with UV light to darken the skin, Sobel explains.
Another option: Protopic, an anti-inflammatory ointment that suppresses the immune response, preventing antibodies from attacking pigment cells. It needs to applied twice daily.
While you can’t make white spots disappear, you can conceal their appearance with a camouflaging cream (such as by Dermablend Corrective Cosmetics) to even out your skin tone.



10. Stretch marks

“Stretch marks are best treated when they’re fresh and still red,” Shamban says.
Moisturizing makes the skin more pliable and helps reduce the appearance of stretch marks. Prescription retinoid cream, such as Retin-A, is effective too.
“Retin-A helps speed up cell turnover and [stimulates] collagen to help repair the damage,” Baumann says.
A more expensive option: Fraxel laser treatments, which create small dots of damage along the affected area, stimulating collagen and elastin production to help fill in stretch marks.



11. Rosacea

Use cleansers and moisturizers with anti-inflammatory properties (such as Aveeno Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer and Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion) to help quell redness.
And here’s an excuse to drink coffee: Caffeine helps to close dilated blood vessels that bring on flushing.
Also steer clear of rosacea triggers: Avoid the sun (and always apply sun block), hot and cold temperatures, spicy foods and alcoholic drinks.
For moderate to severe cases of rosacea, try daily topical treatments, such as microbe-fighting Finacia and Metrogel, or oral antibiotics to reduce inflammation and pimple-like bumps, Sobel says.
IPL laser treatments can zap visible blood vessels and facial redness in one to five sessions, depending on the condition’s severity, Baumann says.



12. Swimmer’s itch

Also called clam digger’s itch, this itchy rash appears after wading or swimming in lakes, oceans, and other bodies of water. You get it when parasites in the water burrow into your skin, causing tiny red spots on areas that your swimsuit didn’t cover. Sometimes, intensely itch welts (hives) and blisters appear.
Children are especially susceptible because they tend to stay in shallow, warmer water.
You can prevent swimmer’s itch by taking the following precautions:
- Stay out of infested water. When the water is infested, you may see a sign that tells you to stay out of the water, or you may hear about someone who recently developed an itchy rash after being in the water.
- Briskly rub your skin (and your child’s skin) with a towel after getting out of the water. The parasites start to burrow when the water on your skin begins evaporating not while you’re in the water.

13. Wrinkles

- Wear sunscreen
- Limit your sugar intake
- Cut out smoking
- Use coconut oil
- Boost your beta carotene
- Try lemon balm leaf tea
- Switch up your sleep position
- Wash your face regularly
- Avoid ultraviolet light
- Up your antioxidants



14. Dark Circles

Apply a cold compress
- A cold compress can help reduce swelling and shrink dilated blood vessels. This can reduce the appearance of puffiness and help eliminate dark circles. Wrap a few ice cubes in a clean washcloth and apply to your eyes. You can also dampen a washcloth with cold water and apply it to the skin under your eyes for 20 minutes for the same effect. Repeat this process if the cloth becomes warm or if the ice melts.
Get extra sleep
- Catching up on sleep can also help reduce the appearance of dark circles. Sleep deprivation can cause your skin to appear pale, making the dark circles more obvious. Allow yourself seven to eight hours of rest to prevent dark circles from appearing.
Elevate your head
- While sleep deprivation can play a part in producing those dark bags under your eyes, sometimes it’s how you sleep. Elevate your head with a few pillows to prevent fluid from pooling under your eyes which can make them look puffy and swollen.
Soak with tea bags
- Applying cold tea bags to your eyes can improve their appearance. Tea contains caffeine and antioxidants that can help stimulate blood circulation, shrink your blood vessels, and reduce liquid retention beneath your skin. Soak two black or green tea bags in hot water for five minutes. Let them chill in the refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes. Once they’re cold, apply the teabags to your closed eyes for 10 to 20 minutes. After removing, rinse your eyes with cool water.
Conceal with makeup
- While makeup and cosmetics do not cure dark eye circles, they can help to camouflage them. Concealers can cover dark marks so they blend in with your normal skin color. However, as with any topical treatment or makeup product, use proper care. Some products can cause your symptoms to worsen and may trigger an allergic reaction. If you begin to experience irregular symptoms from any topical treatment, stop use immediately and schedule a visit with your doctor.



15. Dandruff

- Try Tea Tree Oil
- Use Coconut Oil
- Apply Aloe Vera
- Minimize Stress Levels
- Add Apple Cider Vinegar to Your Routine
- Try Aspirin
- Up Your Intake of Omega-3s
- Eat More Probiotics
- Use Baking Soda
